[Fortio is load testing tool](https://fortio.org/), which runs at a specified query per second (qps) and records an histogram of execution time and calculates percentiles. [Detailed description how to install and use Fortio can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/fortio/fortio). Below I present simple examples on Kubernetes.

Load test using ``fortio`` were prepared as job, where we are going to test 3 different applications running in pods:

```
> cat tests/fortio.yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: load-tests
  namespace: app-load-test
spec:
  parallelism: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        prometheus.io/scrape: "false"
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
        - name: test-app1
          image: fortio/fortio:1.17.0
          command: ["fortio", "load", "-c", "8", "-qps", "12", "-t", "60s", "-allow-initial-errors", "http://app1:8081"]
        - name: test-app2
          image: fortio/fortio:1.17.0
          command: ["fortio", "load", "-c", "8", "-qps", "12", "-t", "60s", "-allow-initial-errors", "http://app2:8082"]
        - name: test-app3-blue
          image: fortio/fortio:1.17.0
          command: ["fortio", "load", "-c", "8", "-qps", "12", "-t", "60s", "-allow-initial-errors", "http://app3:8082"]

```

Job can be created usling below commands:

```
> kubectl apply -f tests/fortio.yaml
job.batch/load-tests created

> kubectl get jobs -n app-load-test
NAME         COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
