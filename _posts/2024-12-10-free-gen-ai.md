title: How to launch an AI learning environment in Kubernetes?

In the previous post on my blog I wrote about [materials and tools for learning AI on my own workstation](https://sebastianczech.github.io/ai/2024/11/05/learn-ai.html), which I used to [launch OpenLLM and ChromaDB services in a Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/sebastianczech/free-genai-app).

The code I prepared will also allow you to launch simple applications that connect to OpenLLM and ChromaDB. This is not the final version, because it will certainly be expanded, but the current implementation will make this adventure with AI easier for you, especially if you like building local labs where everything can be touched, broken and redeployed to better understand the technologies.
