# Understanding and Applying the Scrum Framework

## Empiricism

Manifesto for Agile Software Development:
* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

Empiricism means working in a fact-based, experience-based, and evidence-based manner. Scrum implements an empirical process where progress is based on observations of reality, not fictitious plans. Scrum also places great emphasis on mind-set and cultural shift to achieve business and organizational Agility

3 Pillars of Empiricism:
1. Transparency - we all know what is going on
2. Inspection - check your work as you do it
3. Adaptation - ok to change tactical direction

Agile:
* Agile is a set of values and principles (Agile Manifesto)
* Agile is a way of developing software that reminds us that although computers run the code, it’s people who create and maintain it (The Agile Samurai).
* Agile is the courage to be honest enough to admit that building software is complex and it can’t be perfectly planned since requirements change.
* Constant change, constant continual learning

The 7 Principles of Continuous Innovation
1. Delighting Clients - "Focus work on delighting the client"
2. Self-Organizing Teams - "Do work through self-organizing teams"
3. Client-Driven Iterations - "Do work in client-driven iterations"
4. Delivering Value to Clients in Each Iteration - "Deliver value to clients in each iteration"
5. Radical Transparency - "Be totally open about impediments to improvement"
6. Continuous Self-Improvement - "Create a context for continuous self-improvement by the team"
7. Interactive Communication - "Interactively share stories, questions, conversations"

4 levels of trust to be built:
1. Leadership trusting the teams
2. Teams trusting leadership
3. Team members trusting each other
4. Trust yourself

## Scrum Values

Scrum Values:
1. Focus
2. Openness
3. Courage
4. Commitment
5. Respect

## Scrum Team

The 8 Stances of a Scrum Master:
1. Servant Leader
2. Facilitator
3. Coach
4. Manager
5. Mentor
6. Teacher
7. Impediment Remover
8. Change Agent

Scrum has three accountabilities, each with a different focus :
* Product Owner (*what?*)
* Developers (*how?*)
* Scrum Master

## Events

The Scrum framework describes 5 events: 
1. The Sprint
2. Sprint Planning
3. Daily Scrum
4. Sprint Review
5. Sprint Retrospective

All events are time-boxed and enable progress through adaptation and transparency. 

5 Powerful Things About the Sprint:
1. Focus
2. Predictability
3. Control
4. Freedom
5. Opportunity

## Artifacts

The Scrum framework describes 3 artifacts:
1. The Product Backlog
2. Sprint Backlog
3. Increment

These artifacts provide the team with a minimal set of materials to plan, execute, and review the Sprint.

## Done

The objective of each Sprint is to deliver an Increment. 
The Definition of Done (DoD) provides a way for the team to make what done means transparent.

## Scaling

Scrum is designed to work at the team, product, and organization level.

# Developing People and Teams

## Self-Managing Teams

A fundamental foundational element to Scrum; cross-functional, self-managing and empowered teams are the engine to delivering value.

## Facilitation

Facilitation is a set of practices that help support the collaboration, communication, and creativity of teams and individuals.

## Leadership Styles

There are many different leadership styles ranging from traditional ‘command and control’ to more collaborative or even Machiavellian. Understanding the right style to use at a given time and how different styles can influence - in a positive or negative way - the agile agenda of empiricism, empowerment, and improvement is a key Focus Area.

## Coaching & Mentoring

A key aspect of servant leadership is the ability to coach and mentor the organization, the team, and the business. The objective of coaching and mentoring is to help people get better at their work, deliver more value, or resolve a conflict or problem.

## Teaching

The ability to inspire others to learn and share information in an effective, repeatable, and efficient manner is a key aspect to any agile practitioners' skills. 

# Managing Products with Agility

## Forecasting & Release Planning

Complex problems and the application of an empirical process requires a specific way of planning, estimating, and forecasting.

## Product Vision

The product vision defines the purpose that the product aspires to fulfill. It is defined by the value that the product strives to deliver. 

## Product Value

The ultimate goal is to deliver value to the customer and stakeholders. But value is complex, made up of long-term and short-term impact, internal and external value, and indirect and direct value.

## Product Backlog Management

The Product Backlog is a key artifact within Scrum. It is an ordered list that describes what is needed in the product. The Product Backlog provides transparency into what is happening to the product for the team, organization, and stakeholders. 

## Business Strategy

A product lives within the context of a business strategy. That strategy describes how the Product Vision will be executed in a broader context. 

## Stakeholders & Customers

Effectively working with stakeholders and customers is a key skill for everyone on the Scrum Team. Scrum changes the nature of the interactions, encouraging more frequent collaboration and more open dialogue. 

# Developing & Delivering Products Professionally

## Emergent Software Development

In solving complex problems, the idea of a detailed up-front design has been replaced with an approach that encourages design to emerge and change within the boundaries of an architecture.

## Managing Technical Risk

All products have an inherent set of risks to manage. These risks range from the ability to deliver to technical risks associated with performance and security.

## Continuous Quality

Working in an agile way does not change the importance of product quality. It does, however, change when and where quality is addressed. 

## Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery

Frequent learning is a fundamental concept for Scrum. Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration are a key collection of practices that enable frequent observation of working features.

## Optimizing Flow

The Sprint is a time-box with clear flows within it. For large, complex work, the Sprint is just a small part of a broader flow for the product, business, or even market. 

# Evolving the Agile Organization

## Organizational Design & Culture

Traditional organizations are often structured around Taylorism and mass production concepts in response to simple problems. Complex problems require a different way of organizing. 

## Portfolio Planning

For many large organizations, work is being undertaken in the context of a broader portfolio. That portfolio could be a product, system, value stream, supply chain, or even a program. 

## Evidence Based Management

A fundamental element of Scrum is empirical process; the idea that complex problems require real experience to effectively plan and deliver value. Evidence-Based Management (EBM) is a set of ideas and practices that describe broad measurement areas used to provide an effective, empirical, and value-based approach to any product.
