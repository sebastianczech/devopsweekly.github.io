# Understanding and Applying the Scrum Framework

## Empiricism

Manifesto for Agile Software Development:
* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

Empiricism means working in a fact-based, experience-based, and evidence-based manner. Scrum implements an empirical process where progress is based on observations of reality, not fictitious plans. Scrum also places great emphasis on mind-set and cultural shift to achieve business and organizational Agility

3 Pillars of Empiricism:
1. Transparency - we all know what is going on
2. Inspection - check your work as you do it
3. Adaptation - ok to change tactical direction

Agile:
* Agile is a set of values and principles (Agile Manifesto)
* Agile is a way of developing software that reminds us that although computers run the code, it’s people who create and maintain it (The Agile Samurai).
* Agile is the courage to be honest enough to admit that building software is complex and it can’t be perfectly planned since requirements change.
* Constant change, constant continual learning

The 7 Principles of Continuous Innovation
1. Delighting Clients - "Focus work on delighting the client"
2. Self-Organizing Teams - "Do work through self-organizing teams"
3. Client-Driven Iterations - "Do work in client-driven iterations"
4. Delivering Value to Clients in Each Iteration - "Deliver value to clients in each iteration"
5. Radical Transparency - "Be totally open about impediments to improvement"
6. Continuous Self-Improvement - "Create a context for continuous self-improvement by the team"
7. Interactive Communication - "Interactively share stories, questions, conversations"

4 levels of trust to be built:
1. Leadership trusting the teams
2. Teams trusting leadership
3. Team members trusting each other
4. Trust yourself

## Scrum Values

The Scrum values help teams adopt Scrum and deliver amazing software for their customers.  And, they also create a great place to work. 

Scrum Values:
1. Focus - everyone focuses on the work of the sprint and the goals of the scrum team
2. Openness - scrum team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work
3. Courage - scrum team members have courage to do the right thing and work on though problems
4. Commitment - people personally commit to achieving the goals of the scrum team
5. Respect - scrum team members respect each other to be capable, independent people

Cultural environment is necessary for success, we could try to make the Scrum Values real by focusing on six principles:
1. Self-organization
2. Done means done
3. Empowered Product Owners
4. Servant-leader Scrum Masters
5. Scrum Team ownership for adaption
6. The delivery of business value

As a Scrum Master, you demonstrate servant leadership by coaching with the Scrum values. There are 4 Ways to Coach with the Scrum Values:
1. Establish what the Scrum values mean to us as individuals and as a team.
2. Use the Scrum values to help guide decision-making.
3. Observe and discuss outcomes and behaviors and refine what the Scrum values mean to us.
4. Identify actions for improvement.

## Scrum Team

**Scrum provides the minimal boundaries within which teams can self-organize to solve a complex problem using an empirical approach**

The 8 Stances of a Scrum Master:
1. Servant Leader
2. Facilitator
3. Coach
4. Manager
5. Mentor
6. Teacher
7. Impediment Remover
8. Change Agent

Scrum has three accountabilities, each with a different focus :
* Product Owner (*what?*)
* Developers (*how?*)
* Scrum Master

A great Scrum Master...
* Ensures the entire team supports the chosen **Scrum process**;
* Manages the **impediments** that exceed the self-organizing capabilities of the team and it prevents them in achieving the Sprint Goal;
* Recognizes **healthy team conflict** and promotes constructive disagreement;
* Is prepared to be **disruptive** enough to enforce a change within the organization;
* Understands the power of **self-management**;
* Understands the value of a **steady sprint rhythm** and does everything to create and maintain it;
* Knows how to **truly listen** and is comfortable with silence;
* Understands the **strength of coaching** and has learned some powerful questions by heart;
* **Teaches the Product Owner** how to maximize ROI and meet objectives;
* Is also competent with **XP, Kanban, and Lean**.

*Scrum Master should always prevent a fully booked schedule*. A smart Scrum Master has lots of free space in his/her agenda. The more the better.

The Scrum Master serves the Development Team in several ways, including: Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality.

As a daily preparation a Scrum Master could consider questions like:
* How is my Product Owner doing?
  * Is the Product Backlog in shape?
  * How is he/she managing the stakeholders?
  * What about delivering business value and return-on-investment?
* How is the Scrum Team doing?
  * Are they working together?
  * Is there conflict in the team, do they resolve that?
  * Is the team making decisions?
* How are our engineering practices doing?
  * Is the team caring and improving them?
  * How is the test automation?
  * Is the team expanding their Definition of Done?
* How is my organization doing?
  * Is there inter-team coordination?
  * What organizational impediments are in the way?
  * What about the HR practices?

A day in the life of a Scrum Master:
* Start the day with an open and curious mind (and in my case some good coffee)
* A good first question to consider is "How can I improve the life of the Scrum Team by facilitating creativity and empowerment?"
* Remember: your agenda is as good as empty! Except for the Daily Scrum and maybe some other Scrum events
* You attend the Daily Scrum as an observer. You listen to what is and isn't being said.
* You consider some of the questions I've mentioned earlier.
* Based on your observations you determine your next steps. This might be coaching, consulting, teaching, facilitating, mentoring, managing, problem-solving, conflict navigating or... just sitting with the team, listening, and watching the team.
* Doing "nothing" is a perfect activity for a Scrum Master! The biggest pitfall for a Scrum Master is being too busy and not noticing what is really going on.

Scrum Master:
* Promotes and supports the use of Scrum
* A focus on transparency
* Is a Servant Leader
    * Service to others
    * Promotes a sense of community
    * Holistic approach to work
    * Shared decision-making power
* Serves the PO, Team, and Organization

**Scrum does not care about job titles**

The Famous Spotify Model:
* **Squad**: similar to a Scrum Team
* **Tribe**: collection of Squads that work in a related area
* **Chapter**: a family of people inside a Tribe with similar skills
* **Guild**: a community of practice cross Tribe

Myth 8: The Scrum Master is a Junior Agile Coach

## Events

The Scrum framework describes 5 events: 
1. The Sprint
2. Sprint Planning
3. Daily Scrum
4. Sprint Review
5. Sprint Retrospective

All events are time-boxed and enable progress through adaptation and transparency. 

5 Powerful Things About the Sprint:
1. Focus
2. Predictability
3. Control
4. Freedom
5. Opportunity

## Artifacts

The Scrum framework describes 3 artifacts:
1. The Product Backlog
2. Sprint Backlog
3. Increment

These artifacts provide the team with a minimal set of materials to plan, execute, and review the Sprint.

Myth 2: The Sprint Backlog can’t change during the Sprint

Although the Sprint Goal is fixed during the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog is not - Sprint Backlog is flexible, as long as changes do not distract from the focus on the Sprint Goal. In the context of the Sprint Backlog, the word [“commitment” was replaced by “forecast”](https://www.scrum.org/resources/commitment-vs-forecast). However, commitment is still relevant for the Development Team; they commit themselves to:
* Fulfil the Sprint Goal;
* Delivering working, high-quality and usable software that meets the expectations of the customers and users;
* Working only on the Product Backlog items with the highest value;
* Focus on continuous improvement, learning, and technical excellence;
* Continuously inspect and adapt, by which empiricism is supported;
* Collaborate with all the business people involved;
* The values and elements that build up the Scrum framework.

Where the Sprint Backlog is the expected output, the Sprint Goal is the desired outcome that we want to achieve. Instead of trying to cram as much as we can into a Sprint, our goal should be to reach the desired outcome (the Sprint Goal) with the least amount of output (Sprint Backlog).

Scrum Myth: The Sprint Backlog is a Commitment:
* A set of Product Backlog Items that form a plan to realise the Sprint Goal
* A forecast of functionality in the next increment
* A forecast of the work required
* An artifact to make visible all the work the Development Team has identified as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal

The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality into a “Done” Increment.

## Sprint Goal

Myth: Having A Sprint Goal Is Optional In Scrum

Scrum is intended as a simple, yet sufficient framework for complex product delivery. Scrum provides the minimal boundaries within which teams can self-organize to solve complex problems with an empirical approach.

“The Sprint Goal can be any other coherence that causes the Development Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives”

Three important purposes of Sprint Goals:

* They give guidance during the Sprint on the objective that the Scrum Team wants to achieve in the Sprint, as well as why that is important;
* They help the Development Team focus on what (kind of) work is important, and what is not;
* They promote collaboration by giving Development Teams one clear purpose to work on, instead of separate initiatives.

What happens without Sprint Goals …
* a wide variety of items will be pulled from the Product Backlog during Sprint Planning
* the Sprint Backlog is likely what Development Teams implicitly (or explicitly) commit to instead
* no obvious incentive to collaborate - you are likely to see members of the team picking up ‘their own’ items from the Sprint Backlog and starting work on that
* the Daily Scrum takes the form of a status update - you will hear more “I” than “We”
* members will complete ‘all their work’ at different moments during the Sprint - without a shared objective to encourage people to identify opportunities to help each other, they will instead announce they have nothing to do
* it is hard to know who to invite for the Sprint Review
* the Development Team doesn’t have guidance on how to decide where to invest time and what to let go - it is likely that everything will be considered equally
* it is hard to know when a Sprint is successful -a clear goal can be achieved, and then celebrated - without such a goal, completing the entire Sprint Backlog often becomes the goal
* complain that Scrum Events take a lot of time and feel ineffective - Scrum Events will be experienced more like ‘meetings’ where there’s a lot of talking going on that is not relevant to everyone
* without Sprint Goals, each Sprint implicitly has the same purpose: complete all the work - this makes all Sprints the same

“A Sprint is [ … ] the smallest possible time-box for a Scrum Team to deliver a coherent set of valuable features without losing focus”

Intermission: Examples of Sprint Goals:
* Sprint 1: “This Sprint exists to set up our deployment infrastructure to deploy a secure, working login page.”
* Sprint 2: “This Sprint exists to use-test the interface for entering hours”
* Sprint 3: “This Sprint exists to allow flex agency employees to validate the hours submitted this week.”

Reasons for not having Sprint Goals:
* Product Owners don’t have the mandate to decide what goes on the Product Backlog and in what order
* Product Owners don’t have a vision or strategy for the product
* Product Backlogs span thousands of items
* Scrum Teams may be too large
* Scrum Teams may work on different products or projects at the same time, making it hard to identify one singular goal for a Sprint
* Sprints may be too short or too long
* Scrum Teams may be organized as ‘component teams’
* Scrum Teams often start with the Sprint Backlog and try to reverse-engineer a Sprint Goal
* Some teams do work that is not suited to the time-boxed and purpose-driven nature of Sprints

Tips:
* Help Product Owners plan ahead by identifying potential objectives for upcoming Sprints
* [use the Liberating Structure](https://medium.com/the-liberators/use-nine-whys-to-discover-the-purpose-of-your-team-e2a3125c2b36)
* ask powerful questions to help Product Owners dig deeper into the “Why” of their decisions - “If the entire Product Backlog was lost, what would be the first things you would bring back at this moment in time? Why?”
* The Sprint Review offers potential objectives for the next Sprint(s)
* Use a template to craft Sprint Goals
* Make your Sprint Goal transparent 
* Begin each Scrum Event by stating the Sprint Goal
* Don’t worry if you can’t relate all the items on a Sprint Backlog directly to the Sprint Goal
* Find Sprint Goals that offer guidance during the Sprint and promote collaboration in your team;

“The lack of Sprint Goals is one of the biggest impediments facing Scrum Teams today.”

Challenges with the Sprint Goal:
1. Challenge #1: There is no Sprint Goal
2. Challenge #2: The work is the Sprint Goal
3. Challenge #3: There is no room for anything else
4. Challenge #4: There is no focus on the Sprint Goa
5. Challenge #5: The goal is not a goal

The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of a Product Backlog. It provides **guidance to the Development Team** on why it is building the Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The Sprint Goal **gives the Development Team some flexibility** regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint. The selected Product Backlog items deliver **one coherent function**, which can be the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal can be **any other coherence** that causes the Development Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives (Scrum Guide, 2016).

Six Reasons Why You Need to Pay More Attention to the Sprint Goal:
* The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility
* The Sprint Goal gives sense to the tasks and motivates the Team
* The Sprint Goal unites the Development Team
* The Sprint Goal helps in managing risks
* The Sprint Goal helps with focus and making decisions
* The Sprint Goal helps manage stakeholders' expectations

The Sprint Goal provides guidance to why we are building the Increment

4 Challenges With Sprint Goals (and some tips for resolving them)
1. The Sprint Goal is too big.
2. The Sprint Goal is vague.
3. The team doesn't pay attention to the Sprint Goal during the Sprint.
4. The Sprint Goal doesn't feel meaningful.v

## Done

The objective of each Sprint is to deliver an Increment. 
The Definition of Done (DoD) provides a way for the team to make what done means transparent.

Developers needs to decide what Done means within the organisational context and the product domain. They need to sit down and create a list of things that must be true for every Increment of software that they deliver.

“The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog for future consideration.”

Characteristics of a Definition of Done:
* A short, measurable checklist
* Mirrors shippable
* No further work

Some examples of things to put on your definition of done:
* Increment Passes SonarCube checks with no Critical errors
* Increment’s Code Coverage stays the same or gets higher
* Increment meets agreed engineering standards
* Acceptance Criteria for Increment pass
* Acceptance Tests for Increment are Automated
* Security Checks Pass on Increment 
* Increment meets agreed UX standards
* Increment meets agreed Architectural Guidelines

The Definition of Done is the commitment to quality for the Increment!

Growing your Definition of Done (DoD) - always look for ways that you can increase your quality

The tyranny of work which is nearly done, but not really done, can put a team in servitude to technical debt. 

"Done" criteria which are needed to effect a release, but which cannot yet be observed, constitute a deficit. They should be enumerated here (e.g. by moving them out of the Definition of Done).

Definition of Done Should include a Definition of Undo(ne)

CI/CD/DCA - Continuous Integration + Continuous Delivery + Data Capture / Analysis

Myth 3: In Scrum, releases are done only at the end of the Sprint

The completeness of the increment is defined by the amount of time that is still needed to get the increment to users (e.g. to production).
The more time is needed, the less Agile the organisation is.

Sprint represents a minimal boundary for when to deliver a “Done” increment. There is nothing in the Scrum Framework that prevents Scrum Teams from releasing working software throughout the Sprint, as long as the Product Owner is involved in the decision to release. 

Demo of working software is only a small part of the Sprint Review. The primary purpose of this event is to inspect what was done during the Sprint and to decide what next things can be done to optimize value. The more “Done” the increment is, the more useful the feedback that is gathered will be.
So if the team has already released working software during the Sprint, this makes the Sprint Review an excellent opportunity to inspect feedback from real users and adapt based on the insights that emerge from that. The value of the Sprint Review actually increases as the “Definition of Done” of a team moves towards “Released to production”.

## Scaling

Scrum is designed to work at the team, product, and organization level.

# Developing People and Teams

## Self-Managing Teams

A fundamental foundational element to Scrum; cross-functional, self-managing and empowered teams are the engine to delivering value.

## Facilitation

Facilitation is a set of practices that help support the collaboration, communication, and creativity of teams and individuals.

## Leadership Styles

There are many different leadership styles ranging from traditional ‘command and control’ to more collaborative or even Machiavellian. Understanding the right style to use at a given time and how different styles can influence - in a positive or negative way - the agile agenda of empiricism, empowerment, and improvement is a key Focus Area.

## Coaching & Mentoring

A key aspect of servant leadership is the ability to coach and mentor the organization, the team, and the business. The objective of coaching and mentoring is to help people get better at their work, deliver more value, or resolve a conflict or problem.

## Teaching

The ability to inspire others to learn and share information in an effective, repeatable, and efficient manner is a key aspect to any agile practitioners' skills. 

# Managing Products with Agility

## Forecasting & Release Planning

Complex problems and the application of an empirical process requires a specific way of planning, estimating, and forecasting.

## Product Vision

The product vision defines the purpose that the product aspires to fulfill. It is defined by the value that the product strives to deliver. 

## Product Value

The ultimate goal is to deliver value to the customer and stakeholders. But value is complex, made up of long-term and short-term impact, internal and external value, and indirect and direct value.

## Product Backlog Management

The Product Backlog is a key artifact within Scrum. It is an ordered list that describes what is needed in the product. The Product Backlog provides transparency into what is happening to the product for the team, organization, and stakeholders. 

## Business Strategy

A product lives within the context of a business strategy. That strategy describes how the Product Vision will be executed in a broader context. 

## Stakeholders & Customers

Effectively working with stakeholders and customers is a key skill for everyone on the Scrum Team. Scrum changes the nature of the interactions, encouraging more frequent collaboration and more open dialogue. 

# Developing & Delivering Products Professionally

## Emergent Software Development

In solving complex problems, the idea of a detailed up-front design has been replaced with an approach that encourages design to emerge and change within the boundaries of an architecture.

## Managing Technical Risk

All products have an inherent set of risks to manage. These risks range from the ability to deliver to technical risks associated with performance and security.

## Continuous Quality

Working in an agile way does not change the importance of product quality. It does, however, change when and where quality is addressed. 

## Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery

Frequent learning is a fundamental concept for Scrum. Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration are a key collection of practices that enable frequent observation of working features.

## Optimizing Flow

The Sprint is a time-box with clear flows within it. For large, complex work, the Sprint is just a small part of a broader flow for the product, business, or even market. 

# Evolving the Agile Organization

## Organizational Design & Culture

Traditional organizations are often structured around Taylorism and mass production concepts in response to simple problems. Complex problems require a different way of organizing. 

## Portfolio Planning

For many large organizations, work is being undertaken in the context of a broader portfolio. That portfolio could be a product, system, value stream, supply chain, or even a program. 

## Evidence Based Management

A fundamental element of Scrum is empirical process; the idea that complex problems require real experience to effectively plan and deliver value. Evidence-Based Management (EBM) is a set of ideas and practices that describe broad measurement areas used to provide an effective, empirical, and value-based approach to any product.
