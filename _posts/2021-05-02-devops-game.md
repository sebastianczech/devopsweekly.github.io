- [DevOpsDream](https://devops.games/) - a game for modern tech leaders to improve software delivery and organisational performance, based on real industry insights.
- [Team Retrospectives](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/profiles/team-retrospectives/) - Team Retrospectives, a Microsoft Garage project is an extension for Azure DevOps that provides a first-class experience for retrospectives and general feedback board scenarios. Collect feedback on your project milestones, organize and prioritize, and create and track actionable tasks to help your team improve over time. Optimized for both desktop and mobile. Celebrate the good, improve the bad, and increase productivity with Team Retrospectives.
- [Microsoft Teams with Azure DevOps Services (Collaborate, Communicate and Celebrate)](https://azuredevopslabs.com/labs/vstsextend/teams/)
- [StoStaKee](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/networking_and_servers/9781788995474/app01/app01lvl1sec77/retrospective-games) - This stands for stop, start, and keep. Again, this is an interactive time-boxed exercise focused on past events. This time, you ask everyone to fill in sticky notes related to things they would like to stop doing, start doing, or keep doing, and add them to one of three columns (stop, start, and keep). You then get everyone to voteâ€”again, with sticky dots on the ones they feel most strongly about. Again, you should encourage lots of open and constructive discussions to ensure that everyone understands what each note means. The end goal is a set of actions to take forward.
- [Beer distribution game](https://beergame.masystem.se/) - Play the Beer Game and learn supply-chain principles through a visual simulation.
