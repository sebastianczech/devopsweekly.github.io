[Linux Magic System Request Key](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/admin-guide/sysrq.html) is a combo you can hit which the kernel will respond to regardless of whatever else it is doing, unless it is completely locked up. If you use [echo c | sudo tee /proc/sysrq-trigger](https://askubuntu.com/questions/222835/echo-c-sudo-tee-proc-sysrq-trigger-causes-crash-and-the-system-doesnt-reboot), then it causes crash and the system doesn't reboot. Of course try only on development environment, not production, and do it on your own responsibility :)
