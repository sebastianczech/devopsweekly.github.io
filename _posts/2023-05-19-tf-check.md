In new 1.5-beta version of Terraform it was introduce [check{} block](https://unfriendlygrinch.info/posts/terraform-check-block/), which allows to define assertions based on data source and verify if deployed resources are working as expected. If you are interested about sample implementation, you can find it on [my GitHub in repository "aws-serverless-rest-api"](https://github.com/sebastianczech/aws-serverless-rest-api)
