[reStructuredText](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/reStructuredText/) is a lightweight markup language that is used in static site generators like Sphinx. It contains robust tools for semantic markup, reusing content, and content filters for different kinds of outputs. It’s also easily extendible using custom directives that you can create yourself, allowing you to satisfy a wide variety of documentation needs.

reStructuredText is widely used for Python documentation—both for the Python language itself and for Python libraries.
