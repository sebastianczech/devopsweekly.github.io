Since the premiere of my podcast at the end of February, 4 episodes have already been released. If you haven't had the opportunity to listen what I talk about in the podcast, I invite you to the [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0SLjaZfaCw0WanBzMuCVCc?si=69da1ccd841c48c2) or [Apple Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/pl/podcast/everything-as-code/id1732084317) platform :)


Currently I have covered the following topics:
- Episode 1 – What is the difference between "infrastructure as code" and "configuration as code"?
- Episode 2 – How to define cloud infrastructure using code?
- Episode 3 – Kubernetes cluster for learning
- Episode 4 – What does idempotent, declarative, imperative mean?

The source code and links to the materials can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sebastianczech/podcast-everything-as-a-code).
