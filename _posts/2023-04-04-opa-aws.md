If you are interested in OPA or policy as code and you are familiar with infrastructure as code approach, especially with Terraform, then code prepared by me and available on GitHub allows you to play with Rego, Terraform and Localstack on your local machine. In few step described in [opa-policies](https://github.com/sebastianczech/opa-policies) repository you will find step by step instruction how to setup envrionment on you Docker Desktop and how to execute pipeline with embedded Terraform and Rego. I hope it will be useful for somebody. All feedback is more that welcome :)
