My adventure with Skaffold I have started from [quickstart](https://skaffold.dev/docs/quickstart/), which describes steps connected with installation at the beginning and then all fun begins :) :

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffol
mv skaffold quickstart
cd quickstart/examples/getting-started

skaffold dev
```

In my case ``homebrew`` had older version of ``Skaffold``, I cannot it upgrade it so I changed ``skaffold.yml``:

```yaml
apiVersion: skaffold/v2beta18
kind: Config
build:
  artifacts:
  - image: skaffold-example
deploy:
  kubectl:
    manifests:
      - k8s-*
```

To build and deploy once at a time, we run command:

```bash
skaffold run
```

We can check pod running simple application:

```bash
kubectl get pods
NAME              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
getting-started   1/1     Running   0          2m3s
```

To clean application, we can simply use:

```bash
skaffold delete
```
