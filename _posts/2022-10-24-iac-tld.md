Today I had a presentation on DevOpsDays Warsaw, where I talk about subject [Build infrastructure as a code (IaC) using test-later development (TLD) method](https://github.com/sebastianczech/iac-tld-devops). On my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/sebastianczech/iac-tld-devops) you can find code and links from my lecture :)
