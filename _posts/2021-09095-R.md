To prepare simple R script and to start playing with R packages, simple `Dockerfile` was prepared:

```dockerfile
FROM centos:7
RUN yum install -y epel-release && yum install -y R
# ADD https://github.com/sassoftware/R-swat/releases/download/v1.6.3/R-swat-1.6.3+vb21030-linux-64.tar.gz /usr/local/lib/
# ADD https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/dplyr_1.0.7.tar.gz /usr/local/lib/
# ADD https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/jsonlite_1.7.2.tar.gz /usr/local/lib/
# ADD https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/httr_1.4.2.tar.gz /usr/local/lib/
COPY script.R /usr/local/src/script.R
# RUN R CMD INSTALL /usr/local/lib/dplyr_1.0.7.tar.gz
# RUN R CMD INSTALL /usr/local/lib/jsonlite_1.7.2.tar.gz
# RUN R CMD INSTALL /usr/local/lib/httr_1.4.2.tar.gz
# RUN R CMD INSTALL /usr/local/lib/R-swat-1.6.3+vb21030-linux-64.tar.gz
CMD ["R", "-f", "/usr/local/src/script.R"]
```

Some parts with `ADD` and `RUN` were comented, because installing packages directly from CRAN, there are many dependencies, which are not automatically downloaded. To install package diffent approach was used by doing it directly from `script.R`:

```R
install.packages('dplyr',repos = "https://cran.r-project.org")
install.packages('httr',repos = "https://cran.r-project.org")
install.packages('jsonlite',repos = "https://cran.r-project.org")
install.packages('https://github.com/sassoftware/R-swat/releases/download/v1.6.3/R-swat-1.6.3+vb21030-linux-64.tar.gz', repos=NULL, type='file')
                   
print("Test script in R")s
```

After preparing `Dockerfile` and `script.R`, Docker image can be built using commands:

Build Docker image with simple R script:

```bash
docker build --rm -t centos-r-image .
```

To start container with shell or directly with script started by CMD command, following commands can be used:

```bash
docker run --name centos-r-container --rm -it centos-r-image bash
docker run --name centos-r-container --rm -it centos-r-image
```
