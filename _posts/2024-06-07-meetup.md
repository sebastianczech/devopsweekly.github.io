Yesterday (June 6, 2024) I participated in an extremely interesting meetup of the "Patoarchitekci" podcast, which closed the 3rd season of the podcast.
There were two interesting lectures during the meeting:
- Łukasz on LLM from the perspective of a "Patoarchitect"
- Szymon about IDP

In the first one, Łukasz talked about LLM from three perspectives - personal, professional and corporate.
In turn, Szymon talked about what IDP is, what elements it consists of (CI/CD, hosting, standards, monitoring) and how to do it (and what not to do).

At the very end, a podcast episode with live questions was recorded :)
It will probably appear in the next episode in your podcast application in a few days.

It was definitely worth going and listening :)
