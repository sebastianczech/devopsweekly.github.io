[Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) is great small tool for detecting and preventing hardcoded secrets like passwords, API keys and tokens in git repos. How we can use it ?

Let's create simple folder and initialize git repository:

```
mkdir demo
cd demo
git init
```

then let's create simple script and commit changes:

```
echo hostname > script.sh
chmod +x script.sh
git add script.sh
git commit -am "Simple script"
```

Now let's install [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) and try to use it:

```
brew install gitleaks
gitleaks detect --source . -v
```

Most probably not leaks should be found. Let's something more interesting by creating simple file `provider.tf` with content as below:

```
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-west-2"
  access_key = "lkKJkJsi819jc8s9jd8ciejr5.34.22kdksfASASS"
  secret_key = "alkskadsKKj81jsodio1j98Aasd1.asio32JJJ8ss"
}
```

After creating file, let's commit changes:

```
git add provider.tf
git commit -am "Add TF provider with AWS API key"
```

Let's check what results from gitleaks we have:

```
gitleaks detect --source . -v

```

It has detected `generic-api-key`. Let's remove that file from our repository and commit changes:

```
rm provider.tf
git commit -am "Remove AWS API key"
```

Execute gitleaks and verify that still we have an issue, even if file with secrets was removed. The problem is with git history. Of course there is a solution for that problem, which is described in documentation [removing sensitive data from a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository). 

For that purpose we need additional tool `git-filter-repo`:

```
brew install git-filter-repo
```

which can be used with below approach to remove sensitive data from history:

```
git filter-repo --invert-paths --path provider.tf
git filter-repo --invert-paths --path provider.tf --force
```

Now gitleaks doesn't find any leaks:

```
gitleaks detect --source . -v
