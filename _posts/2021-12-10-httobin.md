Using [httpbin (HTTP Request & Response Service)](https://github.com/postmanlabs/httpbin) we can create easly working HTTP service e.g. for local development. Just pull Docker image and run it on your machine:

```bash
docker pull kennethreitz/httpbin
docker run -p 80:80 kennethreitz/httpbin
```

To query HTTP service you can use several tools like ``curl`` or ``Postman``. If you want to try something new, then maybe it's goot to use [``httpie``](https://httpie.io/), which on macOS can be installed by brew:

```bash
brew install httpie
```

To send request we can reuse existing [examples](https://httpie.io/docs#examples):

```bash
