# Bottleneck

* [Top 11 Bottlenecks That Undermine Success of the DevOps](https://www.veritis.com/blog/top-11-bottlenecks-that-undermine-success-of-the-devops/)
* [How Do I Find and Fix DevOps Bottlenecks in Enterprise Software Delivery?](https://dzone.com/articles/how-do-i-find-and-fix-devops-bottlenecks-in-enterp)

Important questions:
1. Get the right metrics – are you measuring right thing?
2. Do you understand how value flows across the process?
3. Can you easily obtain real-time metrics across the process?
4. Are you able to produce accurate traceability and other performance reports?

The four categories for measuring outcomes:
1. **Time** - lead time to deliver business value
2. **Productivity** - business value in terms of stories
3. **Cost** - cost per story point
4. **Quality** - mean time to resolution (MTTR)

# Theory of constraints

* [Eliyahu Goldratt’s book The Goal in 1984](https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951)
* [Theory of Constraints](https://www.leanproduction.com/theory-of-constraints.html)
* [Getting real with the theory of constraints](https://www.devopsgroup.com/blog/getting-real-theory-constraints/)

Taking a scientific approach to identify the primary factor limiting performance, then working on it until it’s no longer a problem. These three tips will get you off to a good start:
1. Identify your bottleneck
2. Develop and implement a targeted solution
   1. **Identify** – what part of the process limits the rate at which goals are achieved?
   2. **Exploit** – make quick improvements to throughput using existing resources.
   3. **Subordinate** – ensure all actions are geared towards eliminating the bottleneck, everything else is deprioritised
   4. **Elevate** – if the above steps don’t help, deploy additional resource. Attack the constraint aggressively until it’s resolved.
   5. **Repeat** – once the constraint is removed, move on to the next problem causing a bottleneck elsewhere.
3. Optimise for continuous improvement

3 key components:
1. VA (or PT) - Value added time (or Process time) is the amount of time that a team actually spends working on the project.
2. LT - Lead time represents the total time it takes a person or team to complete a task—it is the combination of value added and non-value added.
3. %C/A - % Complete/accurate - his is the percentage of information-based work that is complete and accurate the first time and requires no re-work by downstream processes.

Build your own data-driven stream by following these four steps:
1. Map out your as-is DevOps stream
2. Identify waste
3. Build your to-be DevOps stream
4. Communicate change to your organization

Common pitfalls with work visibility:
1. Overestimating the state of organizational knowledge
2. Failing to map the entire value stream
3. Focusing on the wrong areas for improvement
4. Not granting authority to make changes
