While learning new stuff, I like try not only read, but to experience how it works, deploy something in home lab or in the cloud. Last time I spend few evenings on:
* [Pulumi, which is great alternative for Terraform, if you want to do infrastructure as a code](https://github.com/sebastianczech/learn-pulumi-aws-python)
* [Rego, which is the best starting point to learn policy as a code](https://github.com/sebastianczech/opa-policies)
