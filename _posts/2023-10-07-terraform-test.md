[Terraform 1.6 adds a test framework for enhanced code validation](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-1-6-adds-a-test-framework-for-enhanced-code-validation), which extends possibilities of testing infrastructure. If you are interested how to use [Terraform test command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/test), please check tutorial [Write Terraform Tests](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/test). On my GitHub you can find repository [AWS serverless REST API](https://github.com/sebastianczech/aws-serverless-rest-api), in which I prepared sample test in file [compute_producer.tftest.hcl](https://github.com/sebastianczech/aws-serverless-rest-api/blob/main/infra/compute_producer.tftest.hcl).
