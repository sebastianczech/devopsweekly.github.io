Today I participated in [AWS Community Day Poland 2024](https://awscommunity.pl/). It was great opportunity to learn, to meet people, to discuss interesting topics around AWS and clouds. Below there are my key takeaways from presentations, which I watched today:

- Streamlining Compliance: Leveraging Open-Source Terraform AWS modules:
  - Links:
    - [Terraform AWS modules](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules)
    - [terraform-best-practices](https://github.com/antonbabenko/terraform-best-practices)
    - [weekly.tf](https://www.weekly.tf/)
    - [serverless.tf](https://serverless.tf/)
    - [YouTube - Anton Babenko](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGH0yYPvlCN1VjSFMGVmFgQ)
  - Notes:
    - Compliance framework: CIS, PCI DSS, GPDR, SOC2
    - General tools: AWS Security Hub, [Prowler](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler), [CloudQuery](https://www.cloudquery.io/), [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io/)
    - Auto-remedation tools: [checkov](https://www.checkov.io/), [trivy](https://trivy.dev/), [Terrascan](https://runterrascan.io/)
    - [Make your Terraform modules compliance-ready](https://compliance.tf/)
- AWS Cost Optimization for a busy developer:

    - [Serverless Polska](https://serverlesspolska.pl/)
    - [CloudPouch](https://cloudpouch.dev/)
  - Notes:
    - [Slides](https://sls-polska-downloads.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/AWS+Cost+Optimization+for+a+busy+developer-04.2024.pdf)
    - Cost alarms:
      - create budget set alarms
      - free tier alerts
      - enable cost anomaly detection
    - [AWS Cost Optimization Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/cost-optimization-hub/)
    - Classification of cost optimization techniques:
      - quick win vs. high effort
      - types:
        - waste (idle or overuse):
          - stop
        - misconfiguration:
          - rightsize
          - upgrade e.g. disk from GP2 to GP3
        - architecture:
          - graviton
        - organization level:
          - saving plans
          - reserved instances
    - [AWS Trusted Advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/)
      - 28 cost checks (paid)
      - support minimum business
    - cost optimization techniques for self-checking:
      - EBS - unattached disk drives (do snapshots before delete)
      - EC2 & RDS - scheduler for DEV & TEST environments
        - stop machines at night
        - [AWS Instance Scheduler](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/instance-scheduler-on-aws/) (not for ASG)
      - RDS - destroy idle instances (no connections in last 14 days)
      - NAT Gateway - destroy idle
      - Glue Crawlers - duplicated schedule
      - S3 bucket - no lifecycle policies -> too much outdated versions
      - S3 bucket - intellignet tiering -> use it from the beginning
      - Lambda on Graviton
- Build verifiable and effective application authorization in 30 minutes:
  - Links:
    - [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en)
    - [AVP CLI Tool](https://github.com/Pigius/avp-cli)
    - [build-on-aws](https://github.com/build-on-aws)
  - Notes:
    - challenge - permissions implemented in the code
    - policy-based authorization e.g. AWS IAM
    - authorization as a service
    - [Amazon Verified Permissions](https://aws.amazon.com/verified-permissions/)
    - [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en):
      - policy language
      - policy evaluation and authorization engine
    - Every policy statement must include an effect and a scope:
      -  The effect specifies whether this a permit or a forbid policy
      -  The scope specifies the principal[s], the action[s], and the resource[s] to which the effect applies
      -  Optionally, the statement may also include one or more conditions in the form of when or unless clauses
   -  Proper RBAC - deny by default
   -  ABAC - attributes based access control
   -  AVP vs. self-hosted Cedar
- Sky is the limit - Ryanair's story of customer notifications solution
- Designing and building a scale hybrid network:

    - [AWS Cloud Chronicles](https://www.cloudresearch.tech/)
- Supercharge Lambda functions with AWS Powertools:
