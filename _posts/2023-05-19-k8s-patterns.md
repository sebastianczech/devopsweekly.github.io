Deploying applications in Kubernetes is not always straightforward. Depending on business requirements, sometimes it can be useful to learn from other people or reuse already available patterns. Some of them were presented in [post about 4 container design patterns](https://community.ops.io/danielepolencic/4-container-design-patterns-for-kubernetes-4c9p). Much more examples can be also found in [ebook "Kubernetes Patterns, 2nd Edition"](https://developers.redhat.com/e-books/kubernetes-patterns). Do not reinvent the wheel, use design patterns :)
