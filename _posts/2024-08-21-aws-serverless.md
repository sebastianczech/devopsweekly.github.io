Recently I published Terraform modules for provisioning free serverless in AWS. Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sebastianczech/terraform-aws-free-serverless-modules), modules can be used directly from [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/sebastianczech/free-serverless-modules/aws/latest). If you are interested, I strongly encourage to check [basic example](https://github.com/sebastianczech/terraform-aws-free-serverless-modules/tree/main/examples/basic) and see how easily we can consume and use some of the free services (upon some limits) in AWS. If you have any feedback or feature request, don't hesitate to open issue on GitHub :)
